## Notes:

1) I did a last minute attempt in vain of cython. Sure, it can work if I don't define any C variable types. Working on RPS (hoping to do Rcpp), and fear of fixed income exam chipped at time
2) I sought to write better object oriented code that began to mimic what was in deacon that went above what some of my other friends did
3) Euro-DownOut-Final has the ready to submit project
