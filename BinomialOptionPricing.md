#Binomial Option Pricing

An option is a financial derivative that represents a contract sold by one party (the option writer) 
to another party (the option holder). The contract offers the buyer the right, but not the obligation, 
to buy (call) or sell (put) a security or other financial asset at an agreed-upon price (the strike price) 
during a certain period of time or on a specific date (exercise date).
